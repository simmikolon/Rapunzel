# Rapunzel

Rapunzel is a game heavily inspired by some of the drawings made by my five year old daughter. At her age she has already some incredible drawing skill - at least in my opinion. During the last year she fell in love with Rapunzel. For those who donâ€™t know. Rapunzel is a fairy tale / story of a princess kept in a tower by an evil queen. In order to rescue her a prince tries to climb up that tower using Rapunzels hair as a ladder.
